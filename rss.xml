The creators of this little gem are two artists from Norway - home to the likes of Kygo and Matoma that currently dominate the tropical house genre. It's similar to the original track from Rain Man and MAX, but improves subtly in its melodic sound and emphasis on particular layers of the production and vocals. Could this be a tropical house duo partnership on the rise? Indulge yourself in this glistening track by cranking the volume and catching some sun in this beautiful summer!</p>]]></description>
