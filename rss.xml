            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Moxie Raia - Drugs You Should Try It (Travis Scott Cover)</h1><p>Now this is truly something special... It's unusual to find a cover that is just so perfect and abstract from the original, that you're able to completely forget it's a cover. Moxie Raia has been hailed by many as a 'young Rihanna', and is said to be a name to look for in the future. From this cover alone, we can certainly understand why! The vocals are so soulful and the production is absolutely beautiful. The track hasn't got much to it, but sometimes less is more and that's certainly the case with the distorted guitar and Moxie's hypnotic voice.
