            <title><![CDATA[Conor Maynard - Hotline Bling (Drake Cover) [Griffin Stoller Remix]]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Conor Maynard - Hotline Bling (Drake Cover) [Griffin Stoller Remix]</h1><p>[Official FREE Download] Conor Maynard has truly done something special here. Conor covered the now-popular track 'Hotline Bling' by Drake back in September, in such a beautifully emotional way - something completely different to the original. To top it, Conor has swiftly snuck in some lines from The Weeknd's 'Can't Feel My Face' and Justin Bieber's 'What Do You Mean?'. He's very cleverly manipulated the original lyrics of 'Hotline Bling' to intertwine the other two songs, and it surprisingly works! Now, if that wasn't enough, Californian producer Griffin Stoller has remixed the cover into something with a bit more power; having layered various instruments without compromising Conor Maynard's angelic vocals. Give it a good couple of listens, and here's the download link that you'll inevitably be wanting...

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Moxie Raia - Drugs You Should Try It (Travis Scott Cover)</h1><p>Now this is truly something special... It's unusual to find a cover that is just so perfect and abstract from the original, that you're able to completely forget it's a cover. Moxie Raia has been hailed by many as a 'young Rihanna', and is said to be a name to look for in the future. From this cover alone, we can certainly understand why! The vocals are so soulful and the production is absolutely beautiful. The track hasn't got much to it, but sometimes less is more and that's certainly the case with the distorted guitar and Moxie's hypnotic voice.
