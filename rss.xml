            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>[EXCLUSIVE] Justin Bieber - Love Yourself (Maro x Vento Remix)</h1><p>Today we’re thrilled to present to the world an exclusive debut from newcomers Maro x Vento. The dutch duo have created a sublime tropical house remix of Justin Bieber’s hit single ‘Love Yourself’. The remix is superbly laid back, with the original vocals gently layered onto the smooth, authentic tropical house beat! The edits on the vocals are for the most part subtle, however they have worked wonders on this track; generating a refreshing new take on the track! The duo told us they worked on this remix because they didn’t feel there wasn’t a good tropical house remix, and coming to think of it, we can’t think of one either …until now!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c051f5b97238c20469cab0129b2623096e183db.jpg"></article>]]></description>
