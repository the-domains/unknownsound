  Scandinavia has always been the heart of tropical house and we have no idea
  whyâ€¦ Possibly because they like to create an escape from the cold weather to
  the warmth between the lines of each tropical house track. The creators of
  this little gem are two artists from Norway - home to the likes of Kygo and
  Matoma that currently dominate the tropical house genre. It's similar to the
  original track from Rain Man and MAX, but improves subtly in its melodic sound
  and emphasis on particular layers of the production and vocals. Could this be
  a tropical house duo partnership on the rise? Indulge yourself in this
  glistening track by cranking the volume and catching some sun in this
  beautiful summer!
