When listening to this track, we can't help but think it would be something played at the end of a film. Where two people in a convertible are driving along the Californian coast on a winding mountainside, with the sun setting in the distance and a warm breeze... If you imagine that for a moment and listen to this track, you'll be in bliss. The synth-pop track from Californian quartet Mirror Talk is something that emits a soothing 80's vibe, that's certainly radio ready! 'Some Boys' is a teaser of what's to come in the band's upcoming EP titled '1997' which is slated for release on May 19th.
