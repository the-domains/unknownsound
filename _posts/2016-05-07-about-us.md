All the up and coming music you haven't heard of yet... 

First established in 2014, Unknown Sound originally began as a channel on YouTube. Unknown Sound was the first and only channel dedicated to only providing music that is not currently on YouTube, providing subscribers with exclusive tracks, released on YouTube before anyone else! Described by some of our fans as "More than just a standard music channel" and "A more personal and detailed YouTube channel that specialises in only promoting content that isn't already on YouTube!" 

Now in 2016, we have launched our website to further promote artists, and give them a larger platform to give them the exposure they deserve. If you would like to send us a demo of your track to feature on our channel, please send us an [email][0]. However for us to begin processing your track you will need to ensure that the track is not currently on YouTube, and that you have album artwork readily available. If these two conditions are not met we will be unable to consider the track to be featured on our channel. Thank you.
